This is the translation directory for B2B site.

Translation required vanilla english HTML files with FINAL english texts.

All the original english HTML files need to be put in the original subdirectory (override/delete current ones)

Directory structure and meaning:

i18n -- root
    /originals -- english finished html pages with final texts
    /languages -- directory containing translation texts, subdirectories indicate languages,
                  populated by striptext.py script
                  The CSV files are also present here at the languages folder
    /templates -- directory with "templated" text-less html files created by striptext.py script

To add additional languages for translation simply add subdirectories to languages folder, for example languages/de for german etc.

To create the english text for translation, run striptext.py (as "python striptext.py") in the root directory. The languages/en subdirectory will get filled with translatable files and a convinient en.csv file will appear in the language/en subdirectory for translation.

After the CSV files are translated, copy them to the languages subdirectory (languages/de.csv etc.) and run translate.py (as "python translate.py"). This will create the ouput folder containing final HTML pages with translated texts in all provided languages.

NOTE: the striptext.py script doesn't delete old translation files inside the languages directory (it will override tho). If you need a fresh start, delete the files there, otherwise your en.csv might contain non-needed data.
